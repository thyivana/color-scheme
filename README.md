# color-scheme
A mobile-first web app that generates color schemes using The Color API. Users can select a seed color and a color mode (like monochrome, analogic, or triad) to get a palette of five related colors. Clicking a color copies its hex code to the clipboard. This project was built to practice working with APIs, fetch(), and responsive design.
